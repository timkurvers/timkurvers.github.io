            For the last decade I have mostly worked on web solutions ranging from small websites to
            full-scale experience centers, usually including a good dose of domain modelling,
            architecture, API design and actual frontend / backend development. This space lists
            notable projects I have worked on over the years.

            In my free time I love playing video games, cooking, <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/timkurvers">running</a>
            and tinkering with the more obscure areas of our field — such as WebGL and reverse
            engineering — and occasionally apply these discoveries in coding challenges like

          <p>
            Dota 2 is a multiplayer video game in which two teams of five players battle to destroy
            each other's base.
          </p>
          <p>
            The official game client has support for capturing matches in so-called replay files,
            containing unit positions, player actions, camera movements, chat messages, professional
            commentary and more.
          </p>
          <p>
            ReDota is an open-source experiment to revisit past Dota 2 matches in a web browser,
            visualizing the game as an interactive map with units moving around as the game progresses.
            These aforementioned replay files are parsed client-side without any server involvement.

            As part of its philosophy 'keeping things simple', REMA 1000 — a Norwegian grocer — set
            out to simplify training and operational tasks for its employees. This resulted in multiple
            projects, notably: a training portal, an employee management tool and a tool for clocking
            in and out in the actual stores.

            While employed as a developer at <a href="https://hyperredink.no">Hyper</a> and tech lead

            The training portal went on to become one of the core foundations for <a href="https://about.motimateapp.com">Motimate</a>,
