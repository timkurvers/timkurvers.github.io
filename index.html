          <p>
            For the last decade I have mostly worked on web solutions ranging from small websites to
            full-scale experience centers, usually including a good dose of domain modelling,
            architecture, API design and actual frontend / backend development. This space lists
            notable projects I have worked on over the years.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time I love tinkering with the more obscure areas of our field — such as WebGL,
            networking and binary file formats — and occasionally apply these discoveries in coding
            challenges like <a href="https://github.com/timkurvers/advent-of-code">Advent of Code</a>.

            As part of its philosophy 'keeping things simple', REMA 1000 — a Norwegian grocer — set
            out to simplify training and operational tasks for its store managers and employees.
            This resulted in multiple projects, notably: a training portal, an employee management
            tool and a clocking tool in the actual stores to register employee arrival.

            While employed as a developer at <a href="https://hyperredink.no">Hyper</a> and tech lead
            for the training portal project, my main responsibilities included architecture, third-party
            integrations and frontend / backend development. On the other projects I filled advisory,
            development and maintenance roles.
